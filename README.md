# Simple GO CRUD API

## Prerequisites
To run this code in your own machine, you need to have golang installed, and then download a library called gorilla/mux, which you can do by copying and pasting the given code in to the terminal of your choice:
`go get github.com/gorilla/mux`

## Working
This project is a simple demonstration of how to build CRUD Apps in Golang. For simplicity, I have not used any database, and have just used an array of structs to keep track of my struct 'Movie'. For commercial and professional use cases, I recommend using the golang ORM manipulator GORM for database manipulation. 

The core principles will be the same as in this project, just the routing and database manipulation functions will be different. 


Thank you for visiting this project.
